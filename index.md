# Meet Jackie

### My name is Jackie Piepkorn and I am a Computer Science student at UC San Diego.

## About My Academic & Professional Life
#### ACM AI
I am involved in an on-campus student organization called [ACM AI](https://ai.acmucsd.com/), where we teach
our fellow university students about AI and host other AI related events and competitions.
I am currently an Event Lead, which means my responsibilities consist of the following:
- Creating workshops related to AI topics
- Developing AI competitions for UCSD students
- Hosting professor seminars and student research panels

I've been a part of this org for almost 1.5 years now and it's been a great learning experience.

#### Internships
In terms of software engineering experience, I worked on simulating unmanned underwater
vehicle navigation during my internship in 2020 and I plan to work on the intersection of
SE and AI during my upcoming internship this summer.

#### Academics
My favorite programming language is Java. It's the first language I learned theoretical concepts in,
which was through AP Computer Science A. I also really like Java's syntax and how "complete" it feels, which is why I honestly prefer it over Python.

I mean, look at printing in both languages:

Python
```
print "Hello World
```
vs
Java
```
System.out.print("Hello World)
```
Python is just __too__ simple.

These are the programming languages I've learned at UCSD:
- [x] Java
- [x] Python
- [x] C++
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Go
- [x] C

## About My Personal Life
#### Learning Languages
Outside of the computer science world, I have many hobbies that I *definitely* talk
way too much about. One hobby I've had for many years is learning langauges. I really
enjoy using the [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com) app and I've had it downloaded since 2013. Although I've learned
many languages on Duolingo, I have completed only one course in its entirety so far, which was sparked by my friend's suggestion:
> "You should learn Swahili"

It was a really interesting language to learn so I took an introductory Swahili course at UC Berkeley
because I really wanted to immerse myself in the language. These days on Duolingo, I've been brushing up on Spanish.

#### Hiking
I'm also involved in Hiking Club on UCSD's campus as our founding Social Media Chair.
I like being able to use my creativity for our posts and being able to interact with
so many cool people. Hiking Club has been a fun and friendly community for me here. See some of our club pics [here](hikinggbm.jpg) and [here](sunsetcliffs.jpg).

#### Music
Something I've been up to recently is learning guitar. I'm really into music, including live music <sub>(I go to concerts, like, a lot)</sub>, and I enjoy genres like rock, alt rock, and metal. I've been trying to learn more of my favorite songs on guitar. Here's some that I've attempted to learn so far:
1. Can't Stop by Red Hot Chili Peppers
2. The Dark Sentencer by Coheed and Cambria
3. My Own Summer (Shove It) by Deftones
4. Demolition Lovers by My Chemical Romance

One of my favorite quotes about [learning new things](https://github.com/jackiepiepkorn/CSE-110-Lab/blob/main/index.md#learning-languages) is:
> “The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you.”
― B.B. King

Learning is a really cool thing, and I'm glad I get to [help others learn](https://github.com/jackiepiepkorn/CSE-110-Lab/blob/main/index.md#acm-ai) too
